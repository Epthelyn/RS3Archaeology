# RS3Archaeology
Artefact restoration calculator for Runescape 3

https://epthelyn.github.io/RS3Archaeology/

# How to use
Input the number of damaged and/or restored artefacts available in the list on the left. This can be done by entering the numbers manually or by using the +/- buttons to increment/decrement the number available. The yellow buttons are for damaged artefacts, the green for restored.
If any of the checkboxes from the artefact rows are checked, the calculator will only consider artefacts which have been checked.
The icons in the central divider can be used to turn on and off the display and calculation of artefacts from each of the excavation sites. Greyscale icons are disabled, coloured icons enabled.

The output will appear on the right hand side of the page.
The top section will display how much experience will be gained from restoring the artefacts, how many artefacts have been entered, and how many of each material is required to restore all damage artefacts.

The lower sections indicate the number of chronotes gained from turning artefacts into a collector or the museum, and which collections are partially or fully completed by the current selection. Note that the chronotes total **does not** include chronotes gained from the *completion* of a collection, only the value of the individual items.

# Additional notes
Any artefact quantities entered are saved and will be reloaded if the page is closed and re-opened (or refreshed).
