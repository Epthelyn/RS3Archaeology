# RS3Archaeology
Artefact restoration calculator for Runescape 3

# How to use
Input the number of damaged artefacts available in the list on the left. This can be done by entering the numbers manually or by using the +/- buttons to increment/decrement the number available.
If any of the checkboxes from the artefact rows are checked, the calculator will only consider artefacts which have been checked.
The icons in the central divider can be used to turn on and off the display and calculation of artefacts from each of the excavation sites. Greyscale icons are disabled, coloured icons enabled.

The output will appear on the right hand side of the page.
The top section will display how much experience will be gained from restoring the artefacts, how many artefacts have been entered, and how many chronotes would be gained from turning them in to either collectors or the museum (40% value).
The lower section will display the number of each material required to restore the entered artefacts.
